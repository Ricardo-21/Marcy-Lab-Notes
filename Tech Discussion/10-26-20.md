# How do we declare functions in JavaScript?

* There's two ways to declare a function, declaration notation and expression

** Declaration: ``function name () {};``

** Expression: ``const name = () {};``

# How does a function declared using function declaration notation differ from 
a function declared as a function expression?

* What differs is not only the syntax but as well as what's being hoisted or not.
** A function expression expression will never be hoisted but a function using 
function declaration notation will be.

# What does hoisting mean and how does it impact the way we write our JavaScript 
programs.

* What hoisting does is in a sense move a some code to the very top of the program.
Therefore when a function is hoisted, the whole function is being `moved` to the 
top of the program.

# How does JavaScript handle extra arguments during function invocation? What 
about missing arguments?

*With extra arguments what JavaScript will do is actually ignore the the rest of 
the arguments besides the first one (assuming there's only one parameter in the 
function declaration).

*With missing arguments, JavaScript will shoot out an error because, it has no 
arguments to pass through the function.
